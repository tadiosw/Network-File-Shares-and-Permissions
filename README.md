### Setting Up Shared Network Files & Permissions  

In this lab, we will create shared network folders and configure access permissions. These folders will be set up on the **DC-1** virtual machine, and only specific users will have access based on the assigned permissions.  

#### **Step 1: Create Shared Folders**  
1. On the **DC-1** machine, navigate to the **C:/ drive**.  
2. Create the following four folders:  
   - **read-access**  
   - **read/write-access**  
   - **no-access**  
   - **accounting**

#### **Step 2: Configure Folder Permissions**  
Once the folders are created, we need to share them on the network so that **Client-1** can access them. Assign the following permissions:  

- **read-access** â†’ Set to **read-only** for domain users.  
- **read/write-access** â†’ Allow **read and write** access for domain users.  
- **no-access** â†’ Grant **read and write** permissions to **domain admins only**.

</p>  

#### **Step 3: Test Access from Client-1**  
1. Log into the **Client-1** machine using a standard user account.  
2. Attempt to access the shared folders.  
3. Verify that the assigned permissions work as expected.

</p>  

#### **Step 4: Create a Security Group for Restricted Access**  
1. On the **DC-1** machine, open **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**.  
2. Create a new security group called **"Accountants"**.  
3. Assign specific users to this group.  
4. Configure the **"accounting"** folder to allow access only to members of the **Accountants** group.

</p>  

Now, only users who are part of the **Accountants** security group can access the **"accounting"** folder. If a standard user requires access, they must be added to this group.  

This concludes the tutorial on setting up shared network files and permissions. ðŸŽ¯
